Sports Fixture Portal

Create a database called sport, and in it a table called 'user' for the user login and 'id', 'name', 'league', 'password' as table attributes.

Primary key would be id of type int, while the rest can be varchar.
id should be AUTO_INCREMENT.

The login page allows for username, password, league name validation for minimum length and confirm password and password also has validation so that they are the same.
